# Contributing

Welcome, and thanks for lending a hand! Before we get started, please read the
[Couchbase Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Discussion

We'd love for you to join us on the [Couchbase Forum](https://forums.couchbase.com).
 For more interactive discussions we have `#java`, `#scala` and `#kotlin` channels on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sQ5qbPZuTh).

## Reporting Issues

The simplest way to help is to report bugs or request new features.

We use Jira for issue tracking. There's a Jira project for each JVM client,
and one for the common core-io library:

* [core-io](https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/JVMCBC/)
* [java-client](https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/JCBC/)
* [scala-client](https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/SCBC/)
* [kotlin-client](https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/KCBC/)

To create an issue, or comment on an existing issue, you'll need to sign up
for an account. It's quick and painless (or if it's not, click on the
"Report a problem" link on the signup page or get in touch via the forum).

## Pull Requests

We use Gerrit for code review. The GitHub repo is a read-only mirror of the version in Gerrit.

> We acknowledge Gerrit can be intimidating for new users.
> We're considering alternates that will make it easier for GitHub
> natives to contribute.

You can start by submitting a pull request to the GitHub repo. A bot will
comment on your PR and prompt you to register for a Gerrit account and sign
a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

  1. Visit [https://review.couchbase.org](https://review.couchbase.org) and register for an account.
  2. Review our [Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA)](https://review.couchbase.org/static/individual_agreement.html).
  3. Agree to the CLA by visiting [https://review.couchbase.org/settings/#Agreements](https://review.couchbase.org/settings/#Agreements)
     Otherwise, you won't be able to push changes to Gerrit (instead getting a "`Upload denied for project`" message).

If you need any help along the way, please contact us on the [Couchbase Forum](https://forums.couchbase.com).
